After you use KubeSphere for a certain period of time, it is likely that you need to scale out your cluster with an increasing number of workloads. In this case, KubeSphere provides script to add new nodes to the cluster. Fundamentally, the operation is based on Kubelet's registration mechanism. In other words, the new nodes will automatically join the existing Kubernetes cluster.

{{< notice tip >}}
From v3.0.0, you can use the brand-new installer [KubeKey](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubekey) to scale the master and worker node from a sing-node (all-in-one) cluster.

### Step 1: Modify the Host Configuration

KubeSphere supports hybrid environments, which means the newly-added host OS can be CentOS or Ubuntu. When new machines are ready, add the configurations of the new machine under `hosts` and `roleGroups` of the file `config-sample.yaml`.

{{< notice warning >}}
You are not allowed to modify the host name of existing nodes (e.g. master1) when adding new nodes.
{{</ notice >}}

For example, if you start with [all-in-one installation](../../../quick-start/all-in-one-on-linux/), and you want to add new nodes to the single-node cluster, you can create a configuration file using KubeKey.

```bash
# Assume your original Kubernetes cluster is v1.17.9
./kk create config --with-kubesphere v3.0.0 --with-kubernetes v1.17.9
```

The following section demonstrates how to add two nodes (i.e. `node1` and `node2`) using `root` user as an example. It is assumed that your host name of the first machine is `master1` (Replace the following host name with yours).

```yaml
spec:
  hosts:
  - {name: master1, address: 192.168.0.3, internalAddress: 192.168.0.3, user: root, password: Qcloud@123}
  - {name: node1, address: 192.168.0.4, internalAddress: 192.168.0.4, user: root, password: Qcloud@123}
  - {name: node2, address: 192.168.0.5, internalAddress: 192.168.0.5, user: root, password: Qcloud@123}
  roleGroups:
    etcd:
    - master1
    master:
    - master1
    worker:
    - node1
    - node2
···
```

### Step 2: Execute the Command to Add Nodes

Execute the following command to apply the changes:

```bash
./kk add nodes -f config-sample.yaml
```

Finally, you will be able to see the new nodes and their information in KubeSphere console after a successful return. Select **Cluster Nodes** under **Nodes** from the left menu, or use `kubectl get node` command to see the changes.

```bash
kubectl get node
NAME          STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
master1       Ready    master,worker   20d   v1.17.9
node1         Ready    worker          31h   v1.17.9
node2         Ready    worker          31h   v1.17.9
```
